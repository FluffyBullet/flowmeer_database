## Introduction
This repository is created as an API application to receive, process, store and retrieve data for the front end React.js application FLOWMEER.

To display ability of creating application software of backend and frontend, this repository uses django language with RESTful installations. 


Later in the development of my course - I found minor edits being made to the models to help store information more efficiently and adjust requirements such as the filter options.

## SetUp

The database/back-end of an application is the first feature for creation as you set up "models", reffered as tables, on how to store the data, link together and process efficiently.
On first setup, I drew a table diagram using MS Excel to help organize the data and how they will correlate with each other.

__post__

The post of the website will contain an __image__ paired with a __title__.

Key features of the post will include __flower_tag and __owner__. The __Post ID__ is automatically implemented by the django's model.Models function. __Created_at__ will help the sort by newest post first.

Whilst the project developed, I've opted to to remove the __Region__ filter and made note this will be to be included later.

__comment__

Pairing with the post model, each post will be permitted for a list of comments made from author and other users.
For this, the comment model will need to contain unique ID - stored as __comment_id__. Another automated id field generated by the Django model. __Post_id__ will be used as a foreign key on this table to aid the connection between both tables. 

__counter__

Originally listed as counter, this was edited to be displayed as a Vote system, where others can vote for the post and be displayed with popularity.
Unfotunately with time schedules, votes are enabled, but yet to be utilized on this project, allowing users to sort post by order of most voted and within the family flower category.

__post_id__ will be a foreign key, allowing the table to determine which post has the vote generated against.

__liked_by__ will be linked with the owner of the like with the post. Combination of both id's will limit the table to include 1 like per user per post.

## Testing
On creation of tables, I used django's included APITestCase to ensure data is processed correctly. Pairing this will manual testing, I found this approach allowed me to display potential bugs and repair before causing complications later in the line.

__posttest__ 
**************

This section is created for testing that a user can view all post, the first image is created to fail - confirming that the testing will not automatically default to pass.

## Method

Creation of the database begins with using python's Django framework, which works closely with RESTful API libraries.

In your IDE, open a folder you wish to create your project in and install django with the following command in your terminal:

    pip3 install django

Alternatively, you can specify the version of django you wish to install, by following with a @ tag and the version reference. i.e:

    pip3 install django@3.2.19 (for Dec 2021 version)

Your project will be headed by a "project" then followed by several "applications". Your project will include settings on how the applications behave and routing list.

To create the project, head to your terminal list and enter:

    pip3 install django-admin startproject .

*note the dot at the end is an important addition, commanding the project to be created inside the current folder.*
